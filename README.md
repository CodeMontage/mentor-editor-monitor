Mentor-Editor Monitor
=====================

**Overview**: [The OpEd Project](http://theopedproject.org) manages a [Mentor-Editor program](http://theopedproject.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=97&Itemid=129) in which experienced journalists connect with and give feedback to new and promising voices. This program is administered manually by The OpEd Project staff and has several tedious, inexact components that would be much better addressed using technology.

**Milestone 1**: To monitor follow-up conversations among Mentor-Editor pairs and empower [The OpEd Project](http://theopedproject.org) team with analytics on the conversations.
